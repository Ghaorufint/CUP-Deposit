The **Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning** does not have an application that can centralize all data that is related to Deposit Accounts. Because of this, ad hoc reports are constantly being created to track these accounts.

**Drawdown Interface (DDI)** will allow users to run custom reports on deposit data, as well as provide as mechanism to drill into more specific data about the respective plans, case, and account.


**DDI** will act as a central location to access account data, and provide data access to different subdivisions such as:

- Budget and accounting
- Zoning enforcement
- System analysis

## **DDI** will allow users to perform four major functions:

### 1. All Account Balances:
> DDI will also list all the accounts and the balances in the database, with various filters. Users can categorize the accounts based on LA County Regions, transactions dates, contact names, etc.

### 2. Individual Balance by Plan:
> DDI will list all the accounts categorized by plan. Users can select a plan, and view details about that specific plan. The details will include all the accounts related to the plan, the contact information for each of those accounts, transaction history for each account, etc.

### 3. Individual Balance by Contact:
> DDI will list all the accounts organized by contact. For each contact, users can view all the related cases, account balances, transaction history, etc.

### 4. Non-Matching Account Alert:
> All account numbers must match a case number. There are entries in the LA County Database where this constraint is not satisfied. DDI will filter out those accounts and allow users to send an email to the respective contact for each account, notifying them to change their information in the database to satisfy this constraint.
